# Pizza or Steak - Deep Learning Project

This deep learning project uses a machine learning model to determine whether you should eat **Pizza** or **Steak** based on various input features! Whether youâ€™re looking for a quick snack or a hearty meal, let the model make the decision for you using artificial intelligence.

## Description

The **Pizza or Steak** project is a deep learning-based decision tool built to predict whether you should have pizza or steak based on input data. Using a pre-trained model or a model trained on a dataset of various features, the tool predicts the best meal option for you.

### Key Components:
- **Deep Learning Model**: A neural network-based model for making meal predictions.
- **Dataset**: The model is trained using a dataset with features such as food preferences, nutritional values, or user input (depending on how the project is set up).
- **Prediction**: Based on the input, the model makes a prediction: **Pizza** or **Steak**.

## Features
- Uses a neural network to make predictions about meal choices.
- Can be customized to take various features such as user preferences or image data.
- You can train the model on your own dataset, or use a pre-trained model for quick predictions.
